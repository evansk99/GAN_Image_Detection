# GAN_Image_Detection (MSc Thesis)

The evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has resulted in synthetic images that
are as realistic as ever. Nowadays, even the most meticulous observer can be deceived by their realistic 
nature as distinguishing between photographic and generated images is almost impossible. As a
result, the trustworthiness of images as a medium that carries information is jeopardized. 
These circumstances motivated me for my MSc Thesis to devise a reliable method for photorealistic image detection.
Specifically, the system that was designed employed a combination of image processing and
deep learning techniques to detect images created by generative adversarial networks (GANs)
of different architectures. The proposed method utilized a rearrangement of the discrete
cosine transform (DCT) coefficients to reveal structural abnormalities that occur during the
up sampling stage of image production. Thus transformed images in an alternate frequency
domain were used to train a convolutional neural network. The approach detected images
from similar GAN networks with high accuracy and has the potential to deliver a more generic
solution with subsequent changes.
